Designed for both precision and adaptability, this system leverages cutting-edge data scraping, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning to align with specific trading strategies.</p>

<p><strong>Key highlights of the project include:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Data Scraping</strong>: Real-time market data is sourced from <strong>Dukascopy</strong> and <strong>MetaTrader</strong>, ensuring up-to-date, high-quality input.</li>
  <li><strong>Feature Engineering</strong>: Advanced features are added to the raw data, including historical targets, volume, and enriched attributes essential for robust decision-making.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Preprocessing</strong>: Sophisticated preprocessing pipelines handle:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Time Zone Normalization</strong>: Aligns data across multiple global markets.</li>
      <li><strong>Anomaly Management</strong>: Detects and removes null values and outliers to enhance data integrity.</li>
      <li><strong>Custom Target Engineering</strong>: Generates buy and sell targets based on historical data and pre-defined trading strategies.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Model Training</strong>: A bespoke predictive model is developed, incorporating a specialized trading strategy that includes key parameters such as:
    <ul>
      <li>Take profit and stop loss levels.</li>
      <li>Adaptive trade volumes.</li>
      <li>Strategic signal generation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Prediction and Visualization</strong>: After training, the model predicts the buy or sell signal for the last candle in real time. The results are visually represented through <strong>matplotlib</strong> plots, providing an intuitive view of market behavior and model predictions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Unique Selling Points</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Custom Strategy Integration</strong>: Unlike generic forex prediction systems, this project integrates a tailored trading strategy into the machine learning pipeline.</li>
  <li><strong>Real-Time Execution</strong>: Combines live data scraping and processing for actionable insights.</li>
  <li><strong>Visualization for Decision Support</strong>: Outputs clear, interpretable plots, enabling traders to make data-driven decisions with confidence.</li>
</ul>

<p>This pipeline is a robust demonstration of how artificial intelligence can enhance trading strategies, streamline analysis, and provide a competitive edge in the volatile forex market.</p>

### Usage Instructions

To effectively utilize this forex prediction system, follow the steps outlined below:

#### Initial Setup
1. **Configure API Access**:
   - Locate the `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
   - You will need to set your own `API_TOKEN` and `API_KEY` in the `.env` file. These are essential for accessing the data sources and services that the application depends on.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Ensure that Python and pip are installed on your system.
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
   - Run the following command to install all required dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

#### Running the Application
1. **Execute the Main Script**:
   - Once the setup is complete, you can start the application by running the `test.py` script. This script initializes the entire prediction system, processing data and generating predictions.
   - Execute the script by running:
     ```bash
     python test.py
     ```

#### Additional Information
- Ensure that all configurations in the `.env` and any other configuration files are correct and tailored to your specific requirements.
- The system assumes a network connection is available for accessing remote APIs and data sources as defined in your configurations.
